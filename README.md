# Geant4_MuonDetection

In this study, we will use scintillators and PMT’s to measure the angle and energy of muons that are created when primary particles from outer space interact with particles in Earth’s atmosphere. We will also use a software called TOPAS to simulate these interactions. The goal is to determine the distribution of muons that reach the surface of the Earth
